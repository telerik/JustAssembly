#JustAssembly

JustAssembly is a lightweight .NET assembly diff and analysis tool built on top of the [Telerik JustDecompile Engine](https://github.com/telerik/JustDecompileEngine). As opposed to just comparing signatures, it produces a diff on all assembly contents including the code of the methods.

##Download Binaries

###Merging pull requests

## How to Get Started

JustAssembly uses [JustDecompileEngine](https://github.com/telerik/JustDecompileEngine) as a submodule. In order to get the submodule's code together with the main repo you need to pass `--recursive` to the `git clone` command. If you already cloned the repo in the traditional way, don't worry. First you need to initialize your local configuration file using `git submodule init`. Then use `git submodule update` to fetch all the data from [JustDecompileEngine](https://github.com/telerik/JustDecompileEngine) and check out the appropriate commit.
